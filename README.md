# double-hashing-and-robin-hood-hashing

   Implement one or more hashing algorithms from the following:
	 - Double hashing / Robin Hood / Hopscotch / Cuckoo
   - Compare its/their performance with Java's HashMap/HashSet on millions of
     operations: add, contains, and remove.

   > Generate an array of random integers, and calculate how many distinct
   numbers it has:  static<T> int distinctElements(T[ ] arr) { ... }
   > Compare running times of HashSet and your hashing implementation, for large n.
